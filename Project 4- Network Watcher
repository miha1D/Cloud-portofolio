# Project: Azure Network Watcher – VM Connectivity Troubleshooting

## Summary

This project demonstrates how to use **Azure Network Watcher** to diagnose and understand **network connectivity issues** for an Azure Virtual Machine (VM).  
Tools used include **IP Flow Verify**, **Connection Troubleshoot**, and **Next Hop** to simulate real-world troubleshooting scenarios.

##  What This Project Does

IP Flow Verify** | Checks if a specific port (like 3389) is **allowed or blocked** by NSG rules.
**Connection Troubleshoot** | Tests if the VM can **successfully connect** to an external IP and port
**Next Hop** | Shows where **outbound traffic from the VM** is going next (internet, firewall, etc.)

---

##  Tools Used
- Azure Network Watcher
- Azure Virtual Machine (existing from Project 1)
- NSG (Network Security Group)
- Public IP (from local machine)

---

##  What I Did

1. **Enabled Network Watcher** in the VM’s region
2. Used **IP Flow Verify** to check if RDP (port 3389) was allowed to my VM from my IP
3. Used **Connection Troubleshoot** to simulate my VM connecting to `8.8.8.8` on port `53`
4. Used **Next Hop** to trace outbound routing from my VM to the internet

##  What I Learned
- How to check if a port is open or blocked without logging into the VM
- How to simulate real network issues using Azure’s built-in tools
- How Azure NSG rules and route tables affect VM traffic flow
