# Azure VNet and VM Connectivity Lab 

This lab simulates a real-world Azure network setup with:
- Two subnets
- Two VMs
- A custom NSG
- RDP and Ping access control

##  What I Did

- Created a Virtual Network with two subnets: `web-subnet` and `db-subnet`
- Deployed two Windows Server 2019 VMs in separate subnets
- Created and associated a custom Network Security Group (NSG)
- Enabled RDP and ICMP rules in both NSG and Windows Firewall
- Verified internal and remote connectivity via:
  - RDP
  - Bastion
  - Ping (ICMP)
  - Test-NetConnection

## Technologies Used

- Azure Virtual Network
- Azure Network Security Groups
- Azure VM (Windows Server 2019)
- Azure CLI + PowerShell

##  Key Learnings

- How subnet isolation works inside VNets
- NSG association is **critical** for access rules to apply
- Windows Firewall can block traffic even when NSG allows it
- Difference between public vs private IP access

Steps: 
Azure Networking Lab - Full Project Guide
1. Create a Virtual Network and Subnets (Portal)
 Go to Azure Portal > Virtual Networks > Create a new VNet
 Name: VnetforProject
 Address space: 10.0.0.0/16 - **In my environment**
 Create two subnets:
- web-subnet (10.0.1.0/24)
- db-subnet (10.0.2.0/24)
 No NSG assigned yet during creation.
2. Create Network Security Group (NSG)
 NSG Name: NSGforMyNewProject
 Resource Group: VnetSubnetVMProject
 Inbound Rule: Allow RDP (3389) from Any
 Priority: 1000, Protocol: TCP, Source: Any, Destination Port: 3389
3. Associate NSG to Subnets
 Go to Virtual Network > Subnets > web-subnet and db-subnet
 Edit each and attach NSGforMyNewProject
4. Create Virtual Machines
 VM 1: VM2019Datacentr (in web-subnet)
 VM 2: DB-VM (in db-subnet)
 Both using Windows Server 2019 Datacenter
 Public IP assigned for RDP
 Selected the appropriate subnet during VM creation
5. Issue: Could Not RDP Even With NSG Rule
 NSG had correct rule but wasn't associated to subnet or NIC
 Fix: Associated NSG to the subnet
6. Issue: Could Not Ping Between VMs
 NSG by default blocks ICMP
 Windows Firewall also blocks ping
 Fix: Created custom NSG rule to allow ICMP
 Also enabled ICMP inside the VM using PowerShell
7. Commands Used (CLI + PowerShell)
PowerShell inside VM:
Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server' -Name "fDenyTSConnections" -Value 0
Enable-NetFirewallRule -DisplayGroup "Remote Desktop"
Restart-Service TermService -Force
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow ICMPv4-In" -Protocol ICMPv4 -Direction Inbound -Action Allow

Azure CLI to create ICMP rule:
az network nsg rule create --resource-group VnetSubnetVMProject --nsg-name NSGforMyNewProject --name AllowICMPInbound --priority 1010 --direction Inbound --access Allow --protocol Icmp --source-address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16 --destination-address-prefix "*" --description "Allow ICMP Ping"
8. Final Testing Steps
 From VM1: ping 10.0.2.4
 From VM2: ping 10.0.1.4
 Test-NetConnection for RDP on 3389 also successful
 Bastion also used as a backup method during testing
